# BrainStation-Bandsite
### Project 1, Development Fundamentals

This was the first full project I tackled, and the first time I created a web app beyond basic HTML/CSS; using Flexbox, SASS, vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and APIs. 

The project was broken into 3 sprints, over 3 weeks.

Sprint 1 set up the UI of the site. 
Sprint 2 allowed a new comment to be created, retrieved hard coded existing comments, and displayed the new and existing comments.
Sprint 3 maintained the comments in an API instead of hard coded comments.

This repo is the final product as I submitted it.
